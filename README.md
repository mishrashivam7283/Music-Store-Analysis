# Music Store Analysis
Project Overview:  
This project involves analyzing a music store's dataset using SQL. The dataset contains detailed information about the store's inventory, customers, sales, and employees. The goal is to derive actionable insights into the store's operations, sales trends, and customer preferences.

Objectives  
- Explore and understand the structure of the database.  
- Perform queries to answer business-related questions.  
- Analyze sales performance and customer demographics.  
- Generate insights to improve the music store's decision-making process.

Features  
- Database Exploration: Analyze tables and their relationships within the database.  
- Sales Analysis: Identify top-performing genres, artists, and albums.  
- Customer Insights: Understand customer demographics and purchase behavior.  
- Employee Performance: Evaluate sales performance by employees.  

Technologies Used  
- SQL: For writing queries and analyzing data.  
- Database Management System: PostgreSQL
